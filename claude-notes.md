## COMPLETED: Lightsaber Duel Game with Realistic Physics

Implemented a proper lightsaber combat game with realistic blade physics and collision mechanics as requested.

### ✅ Implemented Features

**Physics System**:
- ✅ Real collision detection using line segment intersection
- ✅ Physics-based collision response with velocity transfer
- ✅ Angular momentum and torque from collision impacts
- ✅ Restitution (bounciness) factor for realistic deflections
- ✅ Angular velocity and damping for blade movement
- ✅ Smooth mouse-following controls with angular interpolation

**Game Mechanics**:
- ✅ Player controls green lightsaber with mouse cursor
- ✅ Multiple enemy attack patterns: Swing, Thrust, Spin
- ✅ Enemies approach from random sides of screen
- ✅ Collision system with proper blade-to-blade interaction
- ✅ Combo system that rewards consecutive blocks
- ✅ Enemy stun mechanics on strong blocks

**Visual Effects**:
- ✅ Particle system for collision sparks
- ✅ Dynamic glow effects that intensify during blocks
- ✅ Visual feedback when blades collide
- ✅ Combo counter display above player
- ✅ Space-themed background with stars
- ✅ Color-coded feedback (stunned enemies turn orange)

**Game Features**:
- ✅ Health system (10 lives)
- ✅ Score tracking with combo multipliers
- ✅ Progressive difficulty with multiple enemies
- ✅ Menu and game over screens
- ✅ Responsive controls and smooth gameplay

### Technical Implementation
- **Physics Engine**: Custom 2D physics with collision detection and response
- **Rendering**: Canvas-based with optimized particle effects
- **Game Loop**: RequestAnimationFrame with delta time for consistent physics
- **State Management**: React hooks with proper separation of concerns

### Key Difference from Previous Implementation
Unlike the previous version where "nothing happened" when lightsabers touched, this implementation features:
- Actual physics responses when blades collide
- Lightsabers deflect off each other with proper momentum transfer
- Angular velocity changes based on collision point
- Visual and mechanical feedback for successful blocks
- Realistic blade behavior that players expect from lightsaber combat

### How to Play
1. Move your mouse to control the green lightsaber
2. Position your blade to intercept red enemy lightsabers
3. When blades collide, they deflect realistically with sparks
4. Strong blocks can stun enemies (they turn orange)
5. Build combos by blocking multiple attacks in succession
